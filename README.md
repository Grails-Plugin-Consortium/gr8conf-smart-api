Grails Smart API
=============

A sample project that shows how to mock, cache, record and replay data using Service Virtualization


## Requirements
* This requires redis to be running local.
* You should also run the project https://github.com/Grails-Plugin-Consortium/gr8conf-services first.  Run with -Dserver.port=9292
* Run this project with -Dserver.port=8282

These ports can be changed as long as you edit the code in the projects where these are hard coded.
